# AUREL — Project Agent Skills

> This file is the project-level design and implementation skill set for the AUREL
> luxury fragrance website. Follow the workflow and build recipes below when
> working on this project.

## AUREL Brand Lock

- **Brand:** AUREL
- **Category:** Luxury niche fragrance
- **Product:** Eau de Parfum
- **Style:** Dark, cinematic, sophisticated
- **Visual language:** Smoked glass, warm metallic details, deep shadows, soft amber light, fragrance mist
- **Brand feeling:** Quiet luxury, mysterious, refined, sophisticated
- **Product world:** Perfume bottle, fragrance liquid, glass, metallic cap/details, atomizer, mist, reflections, scent atmosphere, botanical/material details
- **Primary goal:** Create a premium product showcase/portfolio website for AUREL.

## Asset Rules

1. Inspect the project's `assets/` folder before designing or generating replacement product imagery.
2. Use the provided AUREL perfume/product images as the primary product references wherever they fit.
3. Do not replace, distort, or redesign the supplied product unnecessarily.
4. Preserve the visual identity of the supplied product images when building the UI.
5. Generated visual media should complement the supplied assets rather than compete with them.
6. Never introduce real third-party fragrance brands, logos, trademarks, or recognizable branded packaging.
7. Keep all visible website text in HTML/CSS/JS; never bake text into generated images or video.
8. If an asset clearly conflicts with the AUREL visual direction, prefer another supplied asset before inventing a replacement.

9. The supplied hero video is part of the project's final visual asset set:
   `assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`.
10. The three supplied product images represent the AUREL collection variants:
    AUREL Élan, AUREL Noctis, and AUREL Sombre. Preserve their bottle designs.
11. The hero implementation must use the supplied AUREL hero video for the
    cinematic scroll-driven background. Do not substitute a generated placeholder.
12. If the hero video needs processing, process a copy/output for the website;
    do not overwrite the original raw asset.
## Product Adaptation Rules

Whenever the generic workflow refers to a product, interpret it as AUREL Eau de Parfum.

Use fragrance-specific concepts naturally:
- product materials → smoked glass, liquid, metal, cap, atomizer
- material detail → glass reflections, liquid depth, metallic finish, condensation, mist
- product specifications → fragrance concentration, volume, fragrance family, top/heart/base notes, bottle details
- design story → bottle silhouette, tactile materials, restrained metallic detailing
- environment → sophisticated architectural/interior setting, soft amber light, atmospheric haze
- product motion → slow camera movement, drifting mist, subtle liquid movement, shifting reflections

Do not mechanically replace words. The copy and visuals must read as an authentic luxury fragrance brand.

## Existing Brand Decision

Do not ask the user to create a different brand. AUREL is already selected.

If information is needed that has not been defined above, make tasteful, internally consistent decisions that fit AUREL rather than changing the brand direction.

# $10k Website — project instructions

This file is the complete build process for this project. It runs from a
single sentence: when the user says anything like **"I'd like to make a
website for my brand"**, "build me a landing page", or "create a site for my
product / business", start Phase 0 immediately and follow the phases below in
order. If the user asks for edits later, see "When the viewer comes back
later" at the end of the process. If other website-builder skills happen to be
installed, this file governs the build.

The technical build patterns (encoding, scroll scrubbing, stitching, section
clips, self-test, going live) are in the **Build recipes appendix** at the
bottom of this file. Phase 4 reads it before writing any code.


You are guiding a non-technical viewer through building a premium
scroll-driven website. They will type one sentence to start. From then on,
**you drive**: run the phases in order, ask only the questions listed for each
phase, wait for the answer, and never skip ahead.

You are the designer, director, and engineer. The user is the taste; AUREL brand decisions above are already locked. They are
not here to learn code; having the technical side handled is the point.

## Ground rules (every phase)

- Announce where you are: **"Phase N of 5 — <name>"** at the top of every reply.
- One phase per turn. Finish the phase, summarize what you made, then ask the
  single hand-off question that ends it. Do not start the next phase until the
  viewer replies.
- Ask only the questions written below. If the viewer's opening sentence
  already answers something, skip that question.
- **Clickable choices whenever possible.** If a clickable-choice question tool
  is available, use it for every choice: put the recommended option first and
  mark it *(Recommended)*, one plain line per option. Type-in answers only when
  typing is the only honest answer (describing their brand, giving feedback).
- **Generation is optional and user-directed.** Do not generate replacement
  media when supplied AUREL assets already satisfy the requirement. Never
  regenerate a visual asset without being asked.
- **Inspect everything yourself before showing it.** Read every generated
  image and extract frames from every video. Check for sneaked-in real logos or
  lettering, broken anatomy, off-brand colors (the accent color should appear
  as a physical detail), and whether the composition leaves calm space for
  text. Say what you found honestly. A bad image is a cheap fix now and a whole
  video's credits wasted later.
- Never use real third-party brands, logos, or trademarks. Never bake text into
  images or video — all text is rendered in HTML.
- All files live in the folder the viewer opened in Claude Code. Do not create a
  nested project folder. Raw media stays in `assets/`; only processed files go
  into `website/public/`.
- Everything downstream derives from `copy/brand-kit.md`. Read it at the start
  of Phases 2–5; never ask for information the brand kit already has.
- Talk like a friendly expert: short sentences, plain words, no praise openers,
  no "let me know if you need anything". When a step takes minutes (a render, an
  install, a build), say so in one line when it starts so quiet reads as work.
- If something fails, say exactly what failed and what the viewer should do in
  one or two plain sentences. If the same tool hangs twice in a row, stop
  retrying, say it is down, and suggest a restart.
- Replace the placeholder `BRAND` in every file name below with a lowercase,
  hyphenated version of the brand name (e.g. `halo-audio`).

## Phase 0 — silent preflight, then a checklist

Before replying to the opening sentence, check quietly:

1. **Local AUREL assets** — inspect `assets/images/` and `assets/videos/`
   before doing any visual generation. The required product images and hero film
   are already supplied locally.
2. **Node.js** — `node --version` (needed for the Phase 4 build).
3. **ffmpeg** — `which ffmpeg`. Missing is fine; Phase 4 uses the
   `ffmpeg-static` npm fallback. Never ask the viewer to install Homebrew.

**Higgsfield is not required for this project.** Do not attempt to connect to
Higgsfield, check Higgsfield credits, or stop the project because Higgsfield is
unavailable.

The supplied hero film is:
`assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`

Treat that file as the final hero-film source. Do not generate a replacement
hero video unless the user explicitly asks for one.

Open your first reply with a short ✓/✗ checklist for the local assets, Node.js,
and ffmpeg. If the hero video is missing, tell the user exactly which file is
missing and stop. Otherwise continue with the workflow.

## Phase 1 of 5 — Brand kit

Ask **only** this first (clickable):

> Do you already have a brand, or would you like me to create one from scratch?
> **A)** I already have a brand  **B)** Create a brand from scratch

**If A (existing brand)** — ask these as one grouped list, then wait:

1. Brand name and slogan?
2. What do you sell, and who is it for? (positioning + target audience)
3. Brand personality in a few words? (premium, minimal, bold, playful…)
4. Color palette — hex codes if you have them?
5. Fonts, if you have them?
6. Logo — do you have one, or describe the direction? (Drag a logo or product
   photos into the chat if you have them.)
7. Describe the product or service — materials, features, key specs, or what
   the service actually delivers.
8. The key benefits you want the site to highlight?
9. Visual mood — lighting, textures, atmosphere?
10. The primary goal of the site? (pre-orders, bookings, sign-ups, contact…)
11. Contact details for the site — email, phone, socials, location?

**If B (from scratch)** — ask only these three, then wait:

1. What type of product, service, or business is this for? (I can choose for
   you, or describe yours.)
2. What visual style or mood do you want? (dark and cinematic, light and
   minimal, bold and energetic…)
3. Anything the name, personality, or colors should reflect?

**Then build the workspace.** Create:

```
assets/images/   assets/videos/   assets/references/   copy/   website/
```

Write `copy/brand-kit.md` with these 15 sections, filled from the answers
(invent tastefully for anything a from-scratch brand left open; mark invented
contact details as placeholders):

1. **Brand name** — short, premium, original. Never a real brand.
2. **Slogan** — one line.
3. **Positioning** — what it is and where it sits in the market.
4. **Target audience** — who, concretely.
5. **Brand personality** — 5–8 adjectives plus a sentence.
6. **Color palette** — 5–7 hex codes with roles: background (tinted, never
   pure `#000` or `#fff`), surface, text, muted text, primary accent, optional
   secondary accent, border/line. One strong accent, used sparingly.
7. **Typography** — heading font + body font from Google Fonts, optional
   mono. The heading face should have real character; never Inter or Roboto
   as the display font.
8. **Logo direction** — a simple, original wordmark/mark concept.
9. **Product / service description** — materials, design, features, specs,
   use cases (or, for a service, what is delivered and how).
10. **Key benefits** — 4–6 bullets usable as feature cards.
11. **Visual mood** — lighting, materials, environment, motion, camera style.
12. **Website goal** — the one action the page drives.
13. **Contact & links** — email, phone, socials, location (or placeholders).
14. **Landing page sections** — an ordered list for a scroll-driven page
    (default: Hero, Impact statement, Feature 1, Feature 2, Design & materials,
    Made for the audience, Specs / details, CTA, Footer).
15. **Hero video brief** — a detailed brief for the supplied AUREL hero film:
    the product/subject in its environment, slow camera movement that reads as
    *descending or approaching* (scrolling down should feel like moving down or
    closer), low-key lighting with the accent color as rim light, material
    detail, calm space on one side for headlines, and an explicit composed
    **final frame** where the page will come to rest. The actual hero video is
    already supplied at `assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`.

Do **not** generate images, video, or the website in this phase.

End with a 5-line summary (name, slogan, palette hexes, fonts, site goal) and:

> Read through `copy/brand-kit.md`. Reply **"next"** to generate the reference
> images, or tell me anything to change first.

---

## Phase 2 of 5 — The hero film, then the reference images

This is the phase that makes the site cinematic, so it is a guided
conversation, not a form. Read `copy/brand-kit.md`, then walk the viewer
through three decisions with clickable choices, and only then generate.

### 2a. Explain the effect in one breath

Open with two plain sentences so the viewer knows what they are choosing:

> Your site's hero is one cinematic film that plays *forward as visitors
> scroll down and backward as they scroll up* — they control the camera. The
> headlines and story appear over it, and when the film reaches its last frame
> the page settles into the regular sections below. So the film is the
> centerpiece; let's pick the one shot that fits your brand best.

### 2b. Propose three hero-film concepts (clickable, recommended first)

Design three genuinely different films from the brand kit's product, mood, and
audience. For each, give one line of what the visitor sees as they scroll and
one line of the **resting frame** (where the page settles). Name the cinematic
move each uses so the viewer learns the vocabulary:

- **The approach** — the camera glides toward the subject from its world,
  arriving close at rest. Scrolling down feels like walking up to it.
- **The descent** — the camera moves down through the scene (down a shelf,
  a facade, a pour, a cascade) and lands on the subject. Scrolling down feels
  like going down.
- **The reveal** — start in an extreme macro of materials, pull back to
  reveal the whole subject in its environment.
- **The assembly** — parts, liquid, light, or fabric gather into the finished
  product, which sits composed at the end.
- **The abstract world** — pure light, particles, fabric, or atmosphere in the
  brand's palette with no anatomy to break; each beat maps to a message. The
  most reliable option for services, software, and anything without a
  photogenic object.

Design them by these rules (the ones that decide whether a shot lands on the
first try):

1. **Motion agrees with the scroll.** Scrolling down should read as down,
   closer, or arriving. A subject that flies *up* fights the page.
2. **One subject, one continuous motion, no cuts, no transformations.** AI
   video turning one thing into another is the shot that burns credits.
3. **Plan the ending first.** The last frame is the page's resting layout:
   composed, still, generous margin around the subject so the header and
   cover-cropping don't clip it.
4. **Compose for the words.** Decide where the action lives and keep one side
   of the frame calm for headlines. Never describe that calm side as "empty"
   or "dark" in a prompt — describe it as soft shadow or receding depth.
5. **Prefer forgiving subjects.** Fluids, mist, fabric, metal, light, and
   distant silhouettes render beautifully; hands, faces, keyboards, and
   familiar animals up close show errors instantly.
6. **Keep the subject alive.** Rigid path, living body: drifting steam,
   shifting light, a ripple. Frozen footage reads as dead.

Recommend one and say why in one line. Mention once, as a design fact, that
phone visitors get a beautifully composed still image instead of the scrubbing
film (it plays on laptops and desktops).

### 2c. Choose the format (clickable, recommended first)

> How should the film be built?
> **A) One continuous shot (Recommended)** — a single 12–16 second take in
> three slow phases (arrive → materials → environment). Seamless by nature,
> one generation, the proven default.
> **B) A stitched journey** — two or three shots generated one after another
> and joined so they read as one continuous take (each shot starts from the
> exact last frame of the one before). A longer 20–30 second scroll journey,
> e.g. "outside the building → through the door → into the room". Costs one
> video per segment and each segment gets its own approval.
> **C) Individual shots per section** — the hero gets its film, and two or
> three lower sections each get their own short scrubbed clip pinned to that
> section. Most cinematic, most credits, and each clip must stay in the same
> visual world.

If B or C, ask how many shots (2 or 3) and write a one-line storyboard per
shot: what it shows, its camera move, and its exact final frame (which for B
becomes the next shot's start frame). Middle segments of a stitched journey
end mid-motion; only the final one comes to rest.

Lock the choices into `copy/brand-kit.md` under a new section **16. Hero film
plan**: the concept, the format, the storyboard, the resting frame, and where
on screen the text lives. Phases 3 and 4 build from this section.

### 2d. Generate the reference images

Now the references have a job: they are frame one, the material close-up, and
the environment (or resting frame) of the chosen film, so the video model
knows exactly what world to animate. Preflight with `get_cost: true`, then
ask (clickable):

> I'll generate three 16:9 reference images for the "<concept>" film (opening
> frame, material detail, environment): about N credits, you have M. Go?

**Model:** run `models_explore` (action `get`) and prefer a GPT Image model if
one is listed; otherwise use `nano_banana_pro`. Quality high, aspect `16:9`.
If the viewer dropped a real product photo into the chat, upload it with the
media-upload tool and pass it as an image reference so the subject is *their*
product. Submit all three with `generate_image_batch`, wait with `jobs_wait`,
then download each `result_url` with `curl` to:

```
assets/references/BRAND-hero-reference.png       ← frame one of the film
assets/references/BRAND-material-reference.png   ← the macro phase
assets/references/BRAND-workspace-reference.png  ← the environment / resting frame
```

Prompts — derive every detail from the brand kit and the hero film plan; keep
the subject visually identical across all three; describe the palette as
materials and light, not hex codes. Every prompt ends with: *no people, no
text, no lettering, no logos, no third-party marks, photorealistic, cinematic,
premium.*

**Keep the three job IDs** — Phase 3 passes them as references.

Inspect each file (`Read` it) and describe what you see honestly: sneaked-in
lettering or logos, off-brand colors, whether the calm side is really calm.
Then (clickable):

> Reply **"next"** to generate the hero film, or say which image to regenerate
> and what to change.

---

## Phase 3 of 5 — Hero film

Read `copy/brand-kit.md` (sections 15 and 16). The film **scrubs with
scroll** — every frame will be seen, forward and backward — so motion must be
slow, smooth, and continuous, and the **last frame is where the page rests**.

**Model and price.** Preflight `seedance_2_5` at 1080p with `get_cost: true`
for one segment, multiplied by the segment count for formats B and C. If that
exceeds the balance, or the viewer asks for a cheaper option, preflight one
mid-priced video model from `models_explore` too and present both with one
line each. Then ask (clickable, recommended first):

> Phase 3 of 5 — the hero film: 16:9, 1080p, <duration>, <N segments>, about
> N credits total (you have M). Go?

**Generation reference (if additional media is explicitly requested):**
Do not use a mandatory external video-generation service. The supplied hero
video is the source of truth:
`assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`

If the user explicitly requests a new hero video later, choose an available
generation workflow separately and obtain approval before replacing the local
asset. Existing site implementation must not depend on that external service.

Original generation details:
"omni_reference"`, the three Phase-2 job IDs as `image_references`,
`aspect_ratio: "16:9"`, `resolution: "1080p"`, `bitrate_mode: "high"`,
`generate_audio: false`. Never accept 720p. Decline any preset the generator
offers; use the literal prompt.

Prompt structure (fill from the hero film plan):

> One continuous shot, no cuts. <SUBJECT> <the journey verb: approaches,
> descends, assembles, reveals> from <START STATE> to <END STATE> along <the
> explicit path: a slow forward push, straight down the center, a pull back>.
> The subject stays alive: <small natural motion>. The scene stays alive:
> <drifting atmosphere, shifting light>. Low-key cinematic lighting with
> <accent color> rim light, shallow depth of field, one side of the frame kept
> calm as <soft shadow / receding depth>. The shot ends at rest: <the composed
> final frame, fully described: what sits where, generous margin, why it feels
> arrived>. No people, no text, no lettering, no logos, no fast cuts, no shaky
> camera, no busy background, no heavy particles. Subject identical to the
> reference images.

**Format A — one continuous shot:** `duration` 12–16. One generation, one
approval.

**Format B — stitched journey:** `duration` 6–8 per segment. Generate
segment 1, inspect it, and get the viewer's approval on it alone. Then follow
the stitching recipe in the appendix (§13): grab its last frame as
a full-quality PNG, upload it (media upload → PUT → confirm) and pass it as
`start_image` for segment 2, with a prompt that *continues* the same heading,
speed, and lighting. Land every seam inside motion, never rest-to-rest. Gate
each segment; join them with the single-encode concat. The joined file is the
one hero film.

**Format C — individual shots:** generate the hero film as Format A, then
each section clip at `duration` 5–6 with its own resting frame, same world,
same palette. Save as `assets/videos/BRAND-section-<n>.mp4`.

The hero film is already supplied locally at
`assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`. Inspect it directly. Confirm its dimensions,
extract start / middle / end frames, and run the ending-rest check (appendix §1).
Describe the motion honestly: does it drift, does the ending rest, is the calm
side calm? If the ending keeps moving, prefer a **tail trim** over regeneration.

Do not generate another hero video. Do not require Higgsfield.

> Inspect `assets/videos/aurel-hero.mp4`. Reply **"next"** to build the website,
> or tell me what to change in the existing hero film.

---

## Phase 4 of 5 — Build the website

Read `copy/brand-kit.md` and the **Build recipes appendix** at the bottom of this file before writing code. No questions in this phase — everything needed
already exists. Tell the viewer this build takes 10–15 minutes and that they
can leave it running.

**Order of work:**

1. **Process the video** → `website/public/bg.mp4` with the all-keyframe
   recipe, plus `public/img/poster.jpg` (first frame) and
   `public/img/ending.jpg` (last frame — a free, on-brand design asset for a
   lower section). If `ffmpeg` is missing, use the `ffmpeg-static` node script
   in the appendix.
2. **Scaffold** a Vite + vanilla-JS project in `website/` with `gsap` and
   `lenis`. Files: `index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/style.css`,
   `src/glass.css`, `public/bg.mp4`, `public/img/`, `README.md`.
3. **Layer stack** — a fixed full-screen `<video>` loaded as a Blob and
   scrubbed by scroll progress with gated seeks, a dark tint/gradient layer,
   then the page content scrolling over it. The video is the single background
   for the whole page — never an embedded player, never a small section video.
   The page must be complete and beautiful if the video never loads.
4. **Sections**, in the brand kit's order (default: Hero with wordmark +
   slogan + statement + CTAs; pinned Impact statement with word-by-word reveal;
   Feature 1; Feature 2; Design & materials; Made-for-the-audience card gallery;
   Specs / details; CTA with pricing-style presentation; minimal footer with
   the real contact details). Copy comes from the brand kit — real, specific,
   short sentences in the brand's voice. If web search is available, skim a few
   real customer reviews in the niche first and use the buyers' own words for
   pains and outcomes. No lorem ipsum, no stock filler.
5. **Design** — CSS variables from the brand palette; Google Fonts trimmed to
   the weights used; glass panels/cards where they help readability; accent
   color only for CTAs, highlights, and glows; one signature element unique to
   this site; no two adjacent sections sharing the same layout skeleton;
   generous spacing; responsive; real `<title>`, meta description,
   `theme-color`, and an inline SVG favicon from the logo direction.
6. **Motion** — Lenis smooth scroll; ScrollTrigger pins on 1–3 sections only;
   text reveals paced in scroll distance (a caption must survive several
   normal scroll flicks); card transitions; subtle parallax. Freeze or slow the
   video scrub during pinned sections. Every hero text block gets a legibility
   system: a soft dark scrim behind it plus text shadow, tuned against the
   busiest frame it sits over. Elegant, never busy.
7. **Format-specific media.** Format B: the joined film is the one
   `bg.mp4`; give the hero a taller pin so every beat has room. Format C:
   process each section clip like the hero and pin it with the section-film
   recipe (appendix §14), two or three sections at most.
8. **The form.** Wire the CTA/contact form to the brand kit's contact email
   as a `mailto:` link (or a JS-only success state if contact details are
   placeholders), and say plainly in the README where a visitor's message ends
   up.
9. **Mobile fallback** — poster image instead of the scrubbed video on touch
   devices (poster and video are set from JS inside the same gate so phones
   never download the video); stacked cards; pins removed.
10. **Verify** — `npm install`, `npm run build`, fix every error, start
   `npm run dev`, and run the self-test in the appendix (§11): page loads, console
   clean, `window.__bgv.readyState === 4`, video scrubs at top / middle /
   bottom, hero text readable, links work, phone width looks right. Then run
   the **copy gate**: grep the site for em dashes and the stock words
   *leverage, seamless, empower, unlock, robust, actionable, data-driven,
   solutions, elevate, delve* and rewrite every hit.

Finish with the exact preview URL and one line on how to open it (the Preview
button in Claude Code, or the localhost link in a real browser — the browser is
the true preview for scroll-video pages). Then:

> Phase 4 of 5 done — the site is running at <url>. Scroll all the way through,
> then tell me everything you'd like changed. Big changes first, small ones after.

---

## Phase 5 of 5 — Preview and revisions

This phase repeats until the viewer says they are happy.

- Take feedback as a batch. Restate it as a numbered list, make all the
  changes, rebuild, and report what changed in plain words. Casual notes like
  "this part feels boring" are good bug reports — translate them yourself.
- Structural changes (sections, layout, video) before cosmetic ones (colors,
  copy, spacing).
- If they select an element or attach a drawing in Claude Code, target exactly
  that element.
- Before finishing, re-check the things people forget: real contact details,
  working CTA links, social links, `<title>` and meta description, favicon,
  the mobile view, and the copy gate.
- Never regenerate media in this phase unless explicitly asked.

When the viewer is happy, close with:

> The site is finished and running locally. Whenever you want a change, come
> back to this session and describe it. To put it live, connect the Hostinger
> connector and say: *"Deploy my site to my Hostinger account, my domain is
> ___."* — the going-live notes in the appendix (§12) cover the build flags and
> the two checks to run on the live URL.

---

## When the viewer comes back later

If `copy/brand-kit.md` and `website/` already exist, do **not** restart the
phases. Read the brand kit and the Build recipes appendix, and treat the
request as a Phase-5 revision. If they ask for new media, run only the relevant
part of Phase 2 or 3 and re-process the video if it changed.

---

## Build recipes appendix

Read this before Phase 4. Every brand decision
(colors, fonts, copy, sections) comes from `copy/brand-kit.md`; this file only
covers *how* the site is built and shipped.

### Stack

- Vite + vanilla JavaScript ES modules
- `gsap` + `gsap/ScrollTrigger`
- `lenis` (smooth scroll)
- CSS variables for brand tokens
- All-keyframe H.264 background video at `website/public/bg.mp4`

```bash
cd website
npm create vite@latest . -- --template vanilla   # or write the files directly
npm install gsap lenis
npm install -D ffmpeg-static                      # only if `which ffmpeg` fails
npm run dev
npm run build -- --base=./                        # portable static build
```

Preview builds over HTTP (`npx serve dist`), never `file://`.

### 1. Process the video (do this first)

Raw AI video seeks badly when scrubbed. Re-encode to all-keyframe H.264, no
audio, then pull the poster and ending frames.

With system ffmpeg:

```bash
mkdir -p website/public/img
ffmpeg -y -i "assets/videos/BRAND-scroll-background.mp4" -an \
  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -g 1 -keyint_min 1 -sc_threshold 0 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart website/public/bg.mp4
ffmpeg -y -i website/public/bg.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 website/public/img/poster.jpg
ffmpeg -y -sseof -0.1 -i website/public/bg.mp4 -update 1 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 website/public/img/ending.jpg
```

Size target: roughly 6–12 MB for a 14-second 1080p clip. If it lands far
above that, first try `-g 8 -keyint_min 8` (a keyframe every 8 frames still
scrubs cleanly), then raise `-crf` toward 22, then downscale
(`-vf scale=1728:-2`). Change one variable at a time and judge by scrubbing,
not by pausing. Busy, detailed footage hides compression; smooth gradients
band, so check the calm frames.

Without system ffmpeg (no Homebrew needed) — `website/scripts/encode-bg.mjs`:

```js
import { execFileSync } from "node:child_process";
import ffmpeg from "ffmpeg-static";
const run = (args) => execFileSync(ffmpeg, args, { stdio: "inherit" });
const [input] = process.argv.slice(2);
run(["-y", "-i", input, "-an", "-c:v", "libx264", "-preset", "slow", "-crf", "18",
  "-g", "1", "-keyint_min", "1", "-sc_threshold", "0", "-pix_fmt", "yuv420p",
  "-movflags", "+faststart", "public/bg.mp4"]);
run(["-y", "-i", "public/bg.mp4", "-frames:v", "1", "-q:v", "2", "public/img/poster.jpg"]);
run(["-y", "-sseof", "-0.1", "-i", "public/bg.mp4", "-update", "1", "-frames:v", "1", "-q:v", "2", "public/img/ending.jpg"]);
```

```bash
cd website && node scripts/encode-bg.mjs ../assets/videos/BRAND-scroll-background.mp4
```

### Inspect frames before building (Phase 3)

```bash
mkdir -p assets/review
ffmpeg -y -ss 0 -i raw.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 assets/review/start.jpg
ffmpeg -y -ss 7 -i raw.mp4 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 assets/review/mid.jpg
ffmpeg -y -sseof -0.1 -i raw.mp4 -update 1 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 assets/review/end.jpg
```

### Does the ending really rest? (one command, no guessing)

```bash
ffmpeg -i raw.mp4 -vf "tblend=all_mode=difference,signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YAVG" -f null - 2>&1 | grep YAVG | tail -30
```

Each line is how much that frame changed from the last. An arrival falls back
toward its starting level at the tail; a drift stays high.

### The tail trim (cheaper than a re-roll)

If the shot is strong until the subject drifts near the end, cut at the last
steady frame instead of regenerating. The page maps scroll to *progress*, not
seconds, so a shorter clip costs nothing:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i raw.mp4 -t 11.4 -an -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -g 1 -keyint_min 1 \
  -sc_threshold 0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart website/public/bg.mp4
```

Re-extract the poster and ending frames afterward.

### 2. Layer architecture

| Element | z-index | Role |
|---|---:|---|
| `#bgv` `.bg-video` | 0 | fixed, full-screen, `object-fit: cover`, scrubbed by scroll |
| `.bg-tint` | 1 | radial darkening + gradients for readability |
| `.motion-glow` (optional) | 2 | subtle accent glow, never dominant |
| `#page` | 10 | all sections |
| `.custom-cursor` (optional) | 100 | cursor ring, desktop only |

```html
<video id="bgv" class="bg-video" muted playsinline preload="none" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></video>
<div class="mobile-poster" aria-hidden="true"></div>
<div class="bg-tint"></div>
<main id="page"> …sections… </main>
```

Note: no `src` and no `poster` in the HTML. Both are set from JavaScript
inside the gated path below, so phones never download the video.

```css
.bg-video { position: fixed; inset: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; z-index: 0; will-change: transform; }
.bg-tint  { position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 1; pointer-events: none;
  background: radial-gradient(120% 90% at 50% 45%, rgba(0,0,0,.25), rgba(0,0,0,.75) 100%); }
#page     { position: relative; z-index: 10; }
html, body { overflow-x: hidden; overflow-x: clip; }
```

### 3. Brand tokens

```css
:root {
  --bg: …; --surface: …; --surface-2: …; --text: …; --muted: …;
  --accent: …; --accent-rgb: r, g, b; --accent-2: …; --line: …;
  --font: "Body Font", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-head: "Heading Font", var(--font);
  --font-mono: ui-monospace, monospace;
  --tshadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(5,5,10,.9), 0 3px 12px rgba(5,5,10,.7), 0 10px 44px rgba(5,5,10,.7);
}
```

Accent only on CTAs, active states, highlights, and small glows. The canvas is
never pure `#000` or `#fff`; tint it toward the footage. Heading font on: nav
logo, hero title, impact statement, section headings, feature titles, spec
values, CTA title and price, footer wordmark. Load only the font weights you
use, with `preconnect`.

### 4. Load the video as a Blob, scrub it with gated seeks (main.js core)

Two rules from real deployments. **Blob:** many hosts (shared hosting
included) lack HTTP Range support, so `currentTime` seeks clamp to zero on
the live site while working perfectly on localhost. Fetching the whole file as
a Blob and playing the object URL works everywhere. **Gated seeks:** never
write `currentTime` while a seek is in flight; piled-up seeks are the
difference between smooth and choppy in Chrome.

```js
import Lenis from "lenis";
import gsap from "gsap";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

const lenis = new Lenis({ lerp: 0.1, smoothWheel: true });
lenis.on("scroll", ScrollTrigger.update);
gsap.ticker.add((t) => lenis.raf(t * 1000));
gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0);

const bgVideo = document.getElementById("bgv");
const STATIC_HERO = matchMedia("(max-width: 768px), (hover: none), (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)");

// ---- gated seeks (deadlock-safe) ----
let seekBusy = false, pendingTime = null, lastVideoT = -1;
function requestSeek(t) {
  if (!bgVideo.duration) return;
  if (Math.abs(t - lastVideoT) < 0.008) return;     // write only on change
  if (seekBusy) { pendingTime = t; return; }        // coalesce to newest
  seekBusy = true; lastVideoT = t; bgVideo.currentTime = t;
}
bgVideo.addEventListener("seeked", () => {
  seekBusy = false;
  if (pendingTime !== null) { const t = pendingTime; pendingTime = null; requestSeek(t); }
});
bgVideo.addEventListener("error", () => {           // the deadlock escape + fallback
  seekBusy = false; pendingTime = null;
  document.body.classList.add("video-failed");     // CSS shows the poster layer
});

// ---- scroll → video time (slows during the pinned gallery, see §6) ----
let galleryST = null;
function scrubVideo() {
  if (!bgVideo.duration) return;
  const k = 0.18;
  let eff = window.scrollY, removed = 0;
  if (galleryST) {
    const gs = galleryST.start, ge = galleryST.end, gl = ge - gs;
    removed = gl * (1 - k);
    if (window.scrollY >= ge) eff = window.scrollY - removed;
    else if (window.scrollY > gs) eff = gs + (window.scrollY - gs) * k;
  }
  const p = gsap.utils.clamp(0, 1, eff / Math.max(1, lenis.limit - removed));
  requestSeek(p * (bgVideo.duration - 0.05));
}

// ---- load only on scrub-capable screens, as a Blob ----
async function initVideo() {
  document.querySelector(".mobile-poster").style.backgroundImage = "url('/img/poster.jpg')";
  if (STATIC_HERO.matches) return;                  // phones / reduced motion: poster only
  try {
    const res = await fetch("/bg.mp4");
    bgVideo.src = URL.createObjectURL(await res.blob());
    bgVideo.load();
    bgVideo.addEventListener("loadedmetadata", () => { scrubVideo(); document.body.classList.add("video-ready"); }, { once: true });
    lenis.on("scroll", scrubVideo);
  } catch { document.body.classList.add("video-failed"); }
}
initVideo();

if (import.meta.env.DEV) { window.__lenis = lenis; window.__ST = ScrollTrigger; window.__bgv = bgVideo; }
```

```css
.mobile-poster { position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 0; background: center / cover no-repeat; opacity: 1; transition: opacity .6s ease; }
body.video-ready .mobile-poster { opacity: 0; }
body.video-failed .bg-video { display: none; }
@media (max-width: 768px), (hover: none), (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .bg-video { display: none; }
  body.video-ready .mobile-poster { opacity: 1; }
}
```

The CSS media query and the JS `STATIC_HERO` string must match exactly. For a
video over ~15 MB, stream the Blob with a progress ring instead of a bare
`await res.blob()` so the page is usable while it downloads.

### 5. Pinned impact statement (word-by-word reveal)

```js
function setupImpact() {
  const section = document.querySelector("#impact");
  const pin = section.querySelector(".impact__pin");
  const words = [...section.querySelectorAll(".word")];
  const render = (p) => words.forEach((w, i) => {
    const start = (i / words.length) * 0.72;
    const o = gsap.utils.clamp(0, 1, (p - start) / 0.12);
    w.style.opacity = 0.12 + o * 0.88;
    w.style.filter = `blur(${(1 - o) * 8}px)`;
    w.style.transform = `translateY(${(1 - o) * 18}px)`;
  });
  render(0);
  ScrollTrigger.create({ trigger: section, start: "top top",
    end: () => "+=" + innerHeight * 1.7, pin, scrub: 1,
    invalidateOnRefresh: true, onUpdate: (s) => render(s.progress) });
}
```

**Pace text in scroll distance, not seconds.** Visitors flick, they don't
drag. Every headline over the video should stay fully visible for roughly
80–130vh of scroll with short eased ramps at the edges. Test by flicking
(`window.scrollBy(0, 240)` a few times) — if a line can be skipped or never
reaches full opacity, merge it into its neighbor.

### 6. Pinned one-card-at-a-time gallery ("Made for …")

```js
function setupGallery() {
  const slides = [...document.querySelectorAll("#workflow-track .workflow-card")];
  const N = slides.length;
  const render = (p) => {
    const pos = p * (N - 1);
    slides.forEach((el, i) => {
      const d = pos - i, ad = Math.abs(d);
      el.style.opacity = Math.max(0, 1 - ad / 0.6);
      el.style.transform = `translate(${-d * 130}px, -50%) scale(${1 - Math.min(ad, 1) * 0.06})`;
      el.style.filter = `blur(${Math.min(ad * 10, 14)}px)`;
      el.style.zIndex = String(100 - Math.round(ad * 10));
      el.style.pointerEvents = el.style.opacity > 0.6 ? "auto" : "none";
    });
  };
  render(0);
  galleryST = ScrollTrigger.create({ trigger: "#workflow", start: "top top",
    end: () => "+=" + Math.max(1, N - 1) * innerHeight * 0.72, pin: ".workflow__pin",
    scrub: 1, invalidateOnRefresh: true, onUpdate: (s) => render(s.progress) });
}
```

```css
.workflow .workflow-card { position: absolute; top: 50%; left: clamp(1.5rem, 6vw, 7rem); width: min(420px, 44vw); }
```

Make that selector more specific than `.glass` — `glass.css` may load later and
set `position: relative`.

### 7. Legibility over live footage

Every text block over the video gets all three: the global `.bg-tint`, a local
scrim behind the block that deepens while it is on screen, and the text-shadow
token. Tune against the *busiest* frame the text sits over, not the average.

```css
.hero__copy, .impact__pin { text-shadow: var(--tshadow); }
.hero__copy::before { content: ""; position: absolute; inset: -8% -6%; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none;
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse 74% 62% at 50% 50%, rgba(5,5,10,.62) 0%, rgba(5,5,10,.4) 46%, rgba(5,5,10,0) 76%); }
.btn { text-shadow: none; }
```

Small labels over footage get a chip instead of a big scrim:
`background: rgba(8,8,15,.55); backdrop-filter: blur(10px); border-radius: 10px`.

### 8. Glass panels and buttons

```css
.glass { position: relative; overflow: hidden;
  background: rgba(18,19,25,.46);
  border: 1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--line) 75%, transparent);
  backdrop-filter: blur(22px) saturate(1.18); -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(22px) saturate(1.18);
  box-shadow: 0 24px 80px rgba(0,0,0,.32); border-radius: 24px; }
.glass::before { content: ""; position: absolute; inset: 0; pointer-events: none;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255,255,255,.08), transparent 38%, rgba(var(--accent-rgb), .05)); }
.glass > * { position: relative; z-index: 2; }
.glass-btn--primary { background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--accent), color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 70%, #fff 20%)); color: var(--bg); }
@media (pointer: coarse) { .btn { min-height: 44px; display: inline-flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; } }
```

For a light brand, invert: `rgba(255,255,255,.55)` background, dark text, and a
lighter tint layer.

### 9. Footer dissolve

```css
.footer { position: relative; margin-top: 30vh; padding: 16vh clamp(1.25rem,5vw,6rem) 8vh; background: var(--bg); }
.footer::before { content: ""; position: absolute; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 100%; height: 45vh;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, var(--bg)); pointer-events: none; }
```

### 10. Entrances and living details

- IntersectionObserver adds `.in`; children stagger in 60–150 ms apart. Prefix
  start and end states with the container class (`.card .part`, `.card.in .part`)
  so a later rule can't cancel them, and zero the stagger delays after the
  entrance so hovers don't lag.
- One living element per section at whisper level (a slow glow or drift, 4 s or
  longer, negative `animation-delay` so it is mid-cycle at first paint). Pause
  everything on hidden tabs: `body.paused *, body.paused *::before,
  body.paused *::after { animation-play-state: paused !important }`.
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity`. Never tween `filter` on large layers.
- Reduced motion: show final states, kill transitions, never load the video.

### 11. Self-test (before showing the viewer)

1. `npm run build` passes; `npm run dev` serves; console has zero errors at
   desktop and 375px widths.
2. `window.__bgv.readyState === 4`; scrub at top, middle, bottom, then fast.
3. Every button and link works; the form's success state is real.
4. Hero text readable over the busiest frame; glass cards legible.
5. At least one pinned section works and Lenis does not break it.
6. Phone width: poster shows, no video request, cards stacked, nothing sideways.
7. Rename `bg.mp4` temporarily: page still complete over the poster.
8. Copy gate: `grep -nE "—|leverage|seamless|empower|unlock|robust|actionable|data-driven|solutions|elevate|delve" website/index.html` → rewrite every hit.
9. Fresh-eyes pass: does anything float unexplained, or read as filler?

### 12. Going live (Hostinger)

- Build with `npm run build -- --base=./` and deploy the **contents** of
  `website/dist` (with `index.html` at the top level of the zip), never the
  folder itself, or the live site shows a directory listing.
- `og:url` and `og:image` need absolute URLs — patch them with the live domain
  before the final build. Use the editor, not a shell one-liner (encoding
  damage is a real failure).
- Verify the live URL yourself: HTTPS 200, the video URL itself serves, console
  clean, scrub works (the Blob loader is what makes it work on hosts without
  Range support). A brand-new domain's certificate can take a few minutes.
- Images upload large and clean (~1920px, one high-quality pass); hosts often
  recompress.

### 13. Stitching a journey (Format B) — seams that disappear

Each segment starts from the exact last frame of the one before, so the join
is invisible when the *motion* continues and the seam lands inside movement.

1. Generate segment 1 and get it approved on its own.
2. Grab its last frame at **full quality** (review-grade JPEGs bake compression
   into every later segment):
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -y -sseof -0.1 -i assets/videos/BRAND-seg1.mp4 -update 1 -frames:v 1 -q:v 1 assets/review/seg1-last.png
   ```
3. This project's hero is already a single supplied video, so no external
   media upload, generation job, or `start_image` chaining is required. Only use
   this stitching workflow if the user explicitly requests a future multi-segment
   replacement hero.
4. Write segment 2's prompt so the motion *continues*: same heading, same
   speed, same lighting, picking up exactly where segment 1 rested. If segment
   1 ended near-dark or near-empty, say explicitly what grows out of that
   frame. Middle segments end mid-motion; only the last one comes to rest.
5. Gate each segment separately — a rejected segment is one cheap re-roll.
6. Join the RAW segments with one encode so the joins cannot mismatch:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -y -i seg1.mp4 -i seg2.mp4 -i seg3.mp4 \
     -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v][2:v]concat=n=3:v=1:a=0[v]" -map "[v]" -an \
     -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -g 1 -keyint_min 1 -sc_threshold 0 \
     -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart website/public/bg.mp4
   ```
7. If a join still shows (texture re-imagined at a rest-to-rest seam), replace
   the hard cut with a quarter-second crossfade — offset = length so far minus
   the fade:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -y -i seg1.mp4 -i seg2.mp4 \
     -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]xfade=transition=fade:duration=0.25:offset=6.75[v]" -map "[v]" -an \
     -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -g 1 -keyint_min 1 -sc_threshold 0 \
     -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart website/public/bg.mp4
   ```
   Verify by scrubbing back and forth across each join, not by playing it.

Abstract worlds (light, particles, atmosphere) chain most reliably — nothing
anatomical for the continuation to get wrong. A stitched hero of 20–30 s wants
a taller hero pin (roughly 800–1000vh of scroll) so every beat gets room.

### 14. Individual section clips (Format C)

The hero keeps the fixed full-page film. Each chosen lower section gets its own
short clip, pinned to that section and scrubbed by that section's own
ScrollTrigger progress — never autoplaying.

```html
<section id="feature-1" class="feature feature--film">
  <div class="feature__pin">
    <video class="feature__film" muted playsinline preload="metadata" aria-hidden="true"></video>
    <div class="feature__copy glass">…</div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```js
function setupSectionFilm(sectionSel, src) {
  const section = document.querySelector(sectionSel);
  const video = section.querySelector(".feature__film");
  let busy = false, pending = null, last = -1;
  const seek = (t) => {
    if (!video.duration || Math.abs(t - last) < 0.008) return;
    if (busy) { pending = t; return; }
    busy = true; last = t; video.currentTime = t;
  };
  video.addEventListener("seeked", () => { busy = false; if (pending !== null) { const t = pending; pending = null; seek(t); } });
  video.addEventListener("error", () => { busy = false; pending = null; section.classList.add("film-failed"); });
  if (!STATIC_HERO.matches) {
    fetch(src).then(r => r.blob()).then(b => { video.src = URL.createObjectURL(b); video.load(); });
  }
  ScrollTrigger.create({ trigger: section, start: "top top", end: () => "+=" + innerHeight * 1.6,
    pin: section.querySelector(".feature__pin"), scrub: 1, invalidateOnRefresh: true,
    onUpdate: (s) => seek(s.progress * (video.duration - 0.05)) });
}
```

Process every section clip with the same all-keyframe encode as the hero
(`website/public/section-1.mp4` …) and give each a poster for phones. Keep
the page-level background film scrubbing underneath; pause its scrub during
these pins the same way §4 slows it during the gallery. Limit section films to
two or three — every extra one is another download.

### Gotchas

1. Raw AI video scrubs badly → always re-encode (all-keyframe, or `-g 8`).
2. Scrubbing works locally but not live → the host lacks Range support; the
   Blob loader fixes it.
3. Choppy at the top and bottom of the hero in Chrome → un-gated seeks or
   per-frame DOM writes; both patterns above fix it.
4. Readability beats the video. Deepen the scrim, or move copy to the calm side.
5. Pins shift later triggers → `invalidateOnRefresh: true`, call
   `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after layout changes.
6. `.glass { position: relative }` breaks absolutely positioned cards →
   out-specify it.
7. Claude's built-in preview pane struggles with scroll-video pages → the
   browser at the localhost link is the true preview.
8. Never open the build via `file://` — `fetch` is blocked, so the Blob loader
   falls back to the poster on purpose.
9. Keep motion slow — fast motion is unpleasant when scrubbed by hand.
